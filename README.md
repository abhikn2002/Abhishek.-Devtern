2. Preprocessing the Data:
Clean the text data by removing punctuation, stop words, and performing stemming or lemmatization.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
3. TF-IDF Vectorization:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a technique to convert text data into numerical vectors.
4. Passive Aggressive Classifier (PAC):
Passive Aggressive Classifier is a type of online learning algorithm often used for text classification tasks.
5. Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
